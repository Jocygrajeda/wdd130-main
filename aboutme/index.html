    <h2>Jocy</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone!! I'm Jocelyne, I'm 22 I was born in Mexico and lived my childhood there
        until I moved to Texas when I was 12, I have a younger sister. I speak 3 languages, I
        like to read books in my free time and watch new shows or movies.
        I play video games in my free time.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 7 years,
       My whole family and I got baptized on the same day, it was a beautiful moment for the 
       family. </p>
    <p>At this moment I'm doing a certificate in Web and Computer Programming. I'm excited
        to learn more about web design and Programming. Thank you for reading this (:
